# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Game
The Rock-Paper-Scissors project is a simple web-based game created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, following a tutorial from YouTube. The game allows a user to play against the computer by selecting either rock, paper, or scissors. The computer makes a random choice, and the game logic, implemented in JavaScript, determines the winner based on the classic rules:
     1. Rock beats scissors.
     2. Scissors beats paper.
     3. Paper beats rock.
The project features a clean and straightforward user interface designed with HTML and CSS. It's an excellent way to apply and practice the web development skills learned from YouTube tutorials.
